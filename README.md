## Challenge

How might we make it easier and more efficient to log and track the health and quality of aquariums accurately over time?

## Process

This project began with identifying who our target audience is and what their needs and pain poitns are. I started by writing down three primary types of users:  

- **Experienced Hobbyist** *(User, Customer, Influencer)*
    - Probably older, 30s-50s
    - Fairly tech savvy
    - Early adopter/majority
    - Decent income
    - Keeps good logs
    - Wants easier tracking
    - Less clutter
    - Tired of spreadsheets
- **Beginner/New to Hobby** *(User)*
    - Any age, probably younger
    - May be less tech inclined
    - Late majority
    - Wide income range, probably lower
    - Unfamiliar with logging
    - Not ready for complicated
    - One-stop-shop
- **Proffessional** *(User, Customer, Influencer)*
    - Probably older, 40s+
    - Very tech savvy
    - Early adopter/innovator
    - Solid budgets, within reason
    - Keeps extensive logs
    - Needs to track large systems
    - Record-keeping vital
    - Lots of users

From there, I translated those initial ideas into more fleshed-out personas:

![Proffessional Aquarist](https://asgertler.github.io/static/media/sulema-barba.a09188fc.png)

Using the information gained from creating these personas and receiving feedback from teammates about them, I turned my focus to my ERD that would be the fundamental basis for this entire project in order to effectively achieve CRUD:
